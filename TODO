ToDo
----

Common
------

- Git tag releases


Setup
-----

- Move all container in own repositories, with own docs and so on.
- Cleanup and sort container
- Create and use a base container where possible
- Find out a way to use "one" config file, currently it uses one for each test, which is not perfect.


Milestones
----------

1
-

- Basic setup for first basic tests, the focus here is on only a couple of tests for the beginning.
  These tests should run stable and the results should be consistent.

- Focus already here on good docs and a nice user experience with install and usage.
